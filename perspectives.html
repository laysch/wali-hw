      <h1>Islamic Perspectives on Justice and Truth</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Justice:</strong>  In Islam, being fair and just is really important in everything we do, even when we're talking to people online.</li>
        <li><strong>Peace:</strong> When we communicate in a good and honest way, it helps create peace by stopping arguments and wrong information from spreading.</li>
        <li><strong>Solidarity:</strong> Muslims all over the world (the Ummah) need to work together to make sure truth and kindness are present in everything we do.</li>
