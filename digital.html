      <h2>Context and Significance</h2>
      <p>Social media has made it super easy for fake news to travel fast. This fake news can mess things up, from how people vote to their health decisions. Using honest communication online can help us build a more trustworthy online world.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Social, Ethical, and Technological Concerns</h2>
      <ul class="concerns-list">
        <li><strong>Social:</strong> When people believe wrong information, it causes confusion and can split people apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> As people who use the internet, it's our job to check if something is real before sharing it and to communicate truthfully.</li>
        <li><strong>Technological:</strong> Things like AI and computer programs can make fake news spread even faster, which makes it harder to know what's true.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Global and Personal Connections</h2>
      <p>Think about how wrong information about COVID-19 treatments caused real problems for people around the world. Many of us have probably shared something that turned out to be false without even realizing it. This shows why we all need to be better at understanding what's real online.</p>

      <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
      <ul class="examples-list">
        <li>MIT (2018) found false news spreads six times faster than true news on Twitter.</li>
        <li>Snopes and Reuters Fact Check help counter misinformation with verified facts.</li>
        <li>UNESCO's “Think Before You Share” teaches responsible digital communication.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <p>Using honest language online is really important for building trust and making sure people are responsible for what they share. The idea of being responsible (like the word "amanah" suggests) means we need to check things out, make sure they're clear, and share them carefully.</p>
