      <h1>Understanding Islamic Unity</h1>
      <p>Islamic unity is about Muslim communities focusing on peace, working together, and respecting that everyone is different. It's really important for standing up against unfairness because it makes people feel like they're all in it together and responsible for each other. Our project wants to use this idea to encourage people to act ethically both online and in the real world.</p>
