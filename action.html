      <h1>Take Action</h1>
      <p>Being united as Muslims means focusing on peace, working together with each other, and respecting that everyone is different. This unity is really important for standing up to unfairness because it makes everyone feel responsible for each other and like they're all in it together. Our project wants to use this idea to encourage people to do what's right, both when they're online and in their everyday lives.</p>
